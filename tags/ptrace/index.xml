This is my take to understand what is needed to do in order for Fuchsia to run Linux programs, and how Linux run programs itself. The main reference is RFC 0082 from Fuchsia, from which you definitely will benefit more.
A Tale of Two Alternatives So, you want to run unmodified Linux programs in Fuchsia.</description></item><item><title>zero config proxies</title><link>https://wiki.cont.run/zero-config-proxies/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://wiki.cont.run/zero-config-proxies/</guid><description>In most cases, we can export http_proxy=http://localhost:8081. But at times, programs do not recognize the environment variable http_proxy. We may need to refer to their manual to learn how to configure its proxy settings. It is tedious. For example, the way to specify proxy of git over HTTPS different from that of git over SSH. We need some non-intrusive (transparent) way to specify proxies. Applications are required of nothing. No configuration entry for proxies, no environment variable.</description></item></channel></rss>
