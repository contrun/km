A confidential transaction scheme is a transaction scheme with which the transaction value and the balance of the sender and receiver are encrypted. The zero-knowledge part means that outsider can effectively learn nothing about the values, although he can verify the transaction is not fabricated. The main references are Bulletproofs and Zether. We use Zether to homomorphically encrypt the transaction value so that the we can directly add/subtract ciphertext of the encrypted balance which can then be decrypted into the correct balance after the transaction.</description></item></channel></rss>
