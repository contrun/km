[[https://fuchsia.googlesource.com/fuchsia/+/refs/heads/main/src/proc/bin/starnix][~Starnix~]] is the code name of a ~Fuchsia~ project which proposes to run unmodified Linux programs.
This is my take to understand what is needed to do in order for ~Fuchsia~ to run Linux programs,
and how Linux run programs itself. The main reference is [[https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/contribute/governance/rfcs/0082_starnix][RFC 0082 from ~Fuchsia~]],
from which you definitely will benefit more.

* A Tale of two alternatives
So, you want to run unmodified Linux programs in ~Fuchsia~. You have two choices.

+ Creating a virtual machine which is able to emulate instructions of the binary you want to run on Linux
+ Mimicking Linux only when crossing the system boundary and running other instructions unmodified on the host

Coincidentally, the first approach is what WSL 1 takes, and the second approach is what WSL 2 takes.
The first one is an easy choice if you don't need tight system integration.
You don't need to differentiate the guest kernel and the applications running on the guest kernel.
You know, virtualization is a mature field. All you need to do is port the virtual machine monitor (hypervisor).
After that, The case is settled for good.

The second way has more stringent requirements. First, you will need the same ISA for the Linux program and the host machine.
Second, you need to implement a ton of system interfaces (system calls, or API through system libraries like win32 API).
If the upstream syscall interface changed, you need to
keep up to date. Third, not only there are many syscalls to port, but also there are many unnamed conventions the Linux binaries
expect the running host to satisfy. To name a few, ELF loader, dynamic interpreter, System V interface for process initialization,
POSIX API, stdin and stdout conventions, and so on.

To summarize, it is a great price to pay for tight integration. So why ~fuchsia~ choose to implement this?
And how does ~fuchsia~ implement the POSIX interface. I am not able to answer the first question.
As for the second one, follow me patiently.

* A detour through how debugger works

Ever wonder how a debugger can stop the expectation of a debuggee and inspect the running status of the debuggee,
and even change its control flow?

Here is the pseudocode of a Windows debugger. It is copied from [[https://www.microsoftpressstore.com/articles/article.aspx?p=2201303][How Windows Debuggers Work]].

#+begin_src C++
// Main User-Mode Debugger Loop //
CreateProcess("target.exe",..., DEBUG_PROCESS, ...);
while (1)
{
    WaitForDebugEvent(&event, ...);
    switch (event)
    {
        case ModuleLoad:
            Handle/Ignore;
            break;
        case TerminateProcess:
            Handle/Ignore;
            break;
        case Exception (code breakpoint, single step, etc...):
            Handle/Ignore;
            break;
    }
    ContinueDebugEvent(...);
}
#+end_src

The debugger first creates a new process with the flag ~DEBUG_PROCESS~.
With this on, the operating system will track the running status of the spawned process,
and the debugger process is given special privilege over its child process.
Whenever there is some notable event, the OS returns necessary data to the debugger process
from ~WaitForDebugEvent~.

The debugger can then do whatever it needs to facilitate debugging. For instance,
it can not only read the memory pages of the debuggee,
but also change the control flow, e.g. jump to another address and execute the instruction there.

* Syscalls and how to emulate them in userspace
The moral of the above story is that the operating system normally provides a way for one process to
trace and modify the running status of another process. If we can "arbitrarily" modify the control flow
of sub processes, we may be able to run foreign binaries.

** System Calls
Ultimately, the programs running on an OS interferes with the OS by syscalls (some through an indirection a system library, e.g. ~Fuchsia~
uses [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/VDSO][vDSO]], [[https://lwn.net/Articles/806776/][openbsd uses system libc]]).

Take read a file as an example, this ultimately attributes to three syscalls,
+ Userspace program proposes to open a file in the specified path, the kernel returns a file handle in the form of file descriptor.
+ userspace program continues on by reading the file descriptor. The kernel writes the data it read from block devices, and then
write the bytes to the location the userspace program specified.
+ When the userspace program is done, it proposes to close the file descriptor. The kernel releases the related resources.

All the hardware resources is managed and utilized this way. The kernel provides a unified abstraction, the userspace programs
utilizes this abstraction through the convention of syscalls.

** How to make a syscall manually
See [[https://lwn.net/Articles/604287/][Anatomy of a system call, part 1]], [[https://lwn.net/Articles/604515/][Anatomy of a system call, part 2]] for details.

The gist is that programs put the required arguments in the specified register. It then runs instruction [[https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1817577/what-does-int-0x80-mean-in-assembly-code][~int 0x80~]] to raise a soft interrupt.
The CPU automatically dispatch this interruption to a registered interruption handler, which is a kernel-space procedure.
The kernel space procedure then checks the syscall number and dispatches the call to a specialized handler.

** How to intercept syscalls in Linux
In Linux, we can easily trace the syscalls made by a program with ~strace~.
~strace~ is able to print out all the syscalls a program has called and all the return code of those syscalls.

You might have wondered how ~strace~ can have the ability to inspect syscalls. We need the blessing of Linux kernel to do such thing.
In order to obtain such blessing, ~strace~ needs to, you might have guessed,
make a syscall, [[https://linux.die.net/man/2/ptrace][~ptrace(2)~]]. ~ptrace(2)~ instructs the kernel to stop the execution of the program upon initializing a syscall.
The tracer is then notified to take some actions. In the ~strace~ case, ~strace~ prints out the syscall arguments, and
tells the kernel to continue executing ~syscalls~. Just after the kernel finishes the ~syscall~ logic and before returns the control to the tracee,
the kernel tells the tracer the return code, thus you can see the syscall returning code with ~strace~.

** How to hijack syscalls in Linux
As we have mentioned, the kernel is able to let userspace programs hook into syscalls.
In order to fully emulate syscalls, the userspace program only needs a few more privileges.
For example, some syscalls need to write the result to the memory of the caller, an operation strictly forbidden in normal situation.
The kernel needs to grant memory read and write permission to the tracing program. Fortunately, this is also doable with ~ptrace(2)~.
Well, theoretically this is fantastic. Do we have any real world usage of user space syscalls dispatch? Yes.

*** User-mode Linux
[[file:assets/images/obama-awards-obama-a-medal.jpg]]

User-mode Linux is an ancient poor man's virtualization on Linux. See [[https://www.usenix.org/conference/als-01/user-mode-linux][User-mode Linux paper]] and [[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/virt/uml/user_mode_linux_howto_v2.html][kernel documentation]] for details.

*** gVisor
A modern application is [[https://gvisor.dev/][gVisor]]. According to its [[https://gvisor.dev/docs/][official website documentation]],
#+begin_quote
gVisor is an application kernel, written in Go, that implements a substantial portion of the Linux system call interface. It provides an additional layer of isolation between running applications and the host operating system.
#+end_quote

Quite mouthful, isn't it? In gVisor environment, safe syscalls from the applications are passed to the underlying kernel,
while dangerous ones are censored by a mediator component called [[https://github.com/google/gvisor/tree/master/pkg/sentry][Sentry]].
Sentry passes the syscalls to the [[https://gvisor.dev/docs/architecture_guide/platforms/][Platform]], which emulates real syscalls. When the emulation is done, the results are
delivered to user applications. In this way, gVisor provides greater isolation between applications, which is quite useful in container environment.

** A new mechanism to dispatch syscalls
[[https://www.kernel.org/doc/html/latest/admin-guide/syscall-user-dispatch.html][Syscall user dispatch]].

* The starnix runner
~Fuchsia~ already has the ability to run unmodified Linux binaries. See initial implementation [[https://fuchsia-review.googlesource.com/c/fuchsia/+/485746][here]].
The basic idea is already presented. We need a hook mechanism in the kernel to run specific handler when some exceptional events happened.
Those kinds of exceptional events are called [[https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel/exceptions][exceptions in ~Fuchsia~]].

#+begin_quote
When a thread encounters a fault condition, for example a segfault, execution
is paused and the thread enters exception handling. Handlers that have
registered to receive these exceptions are notified and given a chance to
inspect or correct the condition.
#+end_quote

We now dive into the details.

** hooks in the kernel
As a matter of fact, ~fuchsia~ (more precisely, zircon, ~fuchsia~'s kernel) provides system APIs through [[https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/kernel/vdso][vDSO]]
(which is great for binary compatibility and updatability, see [[https://xuzhongxing.github.io/201806fuchsia.pdf][P20 of these slides]]).
When you invoke normal Linux syscalls in ~Fuchsia~, exceptions are raised.
[[https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:zircon/kernel/lib/syscalls/syscalls.cc;l=89-111;drc=2f0879afeb5e5fba949dc377dcfd8c5ed21d9d76][Here]] is how zircon handles syscalls.

#+begin_src c++
// Stamped out syscall veneer routine for every syscall. Try to maximize shared code by forcing
// most of the setup and teardown code into non-inlined preamble and postamble code.
template <typename T>
inline syscall_result do_syscall(uint64_t syscall_num, uint64_t pc, bool (*valid_pc)(uintptr_t),
                                 T make_call) {
  // Call the shared preamble code
  auto pre_ret = do_syscall_pre(syscall_num, pc);
  const uintptr_t vdso_code_address = pre_ret.vdso_code_address;
  ProcessDispatcher* current_process = pre_ret.current_process;

  // Validate the user space program counter originated from the vdso at the proper location,
  // otherwise call through to the invalid syscall handler
  uint64_t ret;
  if (unlikely(!valid_pc(pc - vdso_code_address))) {
    ret = sys_invalid_syscall(syscall_num, pc, vdso_code_address);
  } else {
    // Per syscall inlined routine to marshall args appropriately
    ret = make_call(current_process);
  }

  // Call through to the shared postamble code
  return do_syscall_post(ret, syscall_num);
}
#+end_src

The line ~ret = sys_invalid_syscall(syscall_num, pc, vdso_code_address)~ saves the original syscall number, raises an exception.
Then the kernel would suspend current thread and notify the registered exception handler.

** handlers in the userspace
[[https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/proc/bin/starnix/runner.rs;l=69-152;drc=5744210c57bc34495941363f6ae1b7423483fe0b][Here]] is the code snippet copied from ~fuchsia~'s ~starnix~ runner.

        );

#+end_src

Sans a few setup work (see elf loader, dynamic interpreter and process initialization below) and the actual dispatch logic,
this is how ~starnix~ runs unmodified Linux binaries. The ~starnix~ runner first set up an exception channel.
and then runs a loop in which it waits for any message from the exception channel.
When the data arrive at this channel, The runner first checks if this message is actually bad syscall exception.
If so, the runner acquires the current registers state, then dispatches the original
syscall number and its arguments to the user-defined functions. The actually implementations are scattered among different
files named ~syscalls.rs~. As an example, here is the link to [[https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/proc/bin/starnix/fs/socket/syscalls.rs;l=612-633][~sendto~]].

** For a Few Dollars More
Although I have mentioned how ~starnix~ intercepts and hijacks normal Linux syscalls. There are still quite
a few things omitted for Linux programs running normally.

*** More syscalls
There are [[https://filippo.io/linux-syscall-table/][quite a few syscalls]] to reimplement. Linux offers many syscalls, most of which require a reimplementation.
Some syscalls like ~gettimeofday~ need only stateless shims, while some require ~starnix~ to save state internally.
For example, you may not want other process to access your file descriptor.
When ~starnix~ opens a file on the Linux binaries' behave, it needs to keep track of the ownership of handles.
Some syscalls are performance critical. Any implementation needs careful measurement.
[[https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/contribute/governance/rfcs/0082_starnix#memory][Memory access]] is an example.

*** ELF Loader and Dynamic interpreter
Programs do not automagically run on a platform. The platform need to do a few setup work.
The first thing it needs to do is load the program from disk to memory.
The elf loader for ~fuchsia~ is implemented [[https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/proc/bin/starnix/loader.rs;drc=a447744ac172d77b4165342360c579a7fecb181b][here]].
To complicate things further, not all programs are self-contained. Some of them require a symbol resolution at runtime.
After the program is loaded into memory. Depending on whether the program has a ~PT_INTERP~ segment, the runner may run
the dynamic interpreter first. The interpreter resolves symbols in the dynamically-linked binaries and then
jumps to the entry point address (which is available from the auxiliary vector ~AT_ENTRY~, see below) of this program.

*** Process initialization
On Linux, the kernel does a few setup works for the programs which is quite different from the process initialization
logic of ~Fuchsia~. For example, the Linux kernel set up the stack for the binaries, and then push some auxiliary vector, environment variables, argv and argc
onto the stack (See [[https://gitlab.com/x86-psABIs/x86-64-ABI/-/blob/a0ea20c1a611e51891ea71687ba844abb86e987b/x86-64-ABI/low-level-sys-info.tex#L998][System V x86 psABIs]], [[https://lwn.net/Articles/630727/][How programs get run]] and [[https://lwn.net/Articles/631631/][How programs get run: ELF binaries]] for details),
while on ~Fuchsia~ leverages [[https://fuchsia.dev/fuchsia-src/concepts/process/program_loading#the_processargs_protocol][processargs protocol]] to pass initial environmental information to the binary.
The environmental information may be in a quite different format. Here is [[https://cs.opensource.google/fuchsia/fuchsia/+/main:src/proc/bin/starnix/loader.rs;l=229-242;drc=a447744ac172d77b4165342360c579a7fecb181b][the shim]] to this.

#+begin_src rust
    let stack = stack_base + (stack_size - 8);

    let creds = current_task.creds.read();
    let auxv = vec![
        (AT_UID, creds.uid as u64),
        (AT_EUID, creds.euid as u64),
        (AT_GID, creds.gid as u64),
        (AT_EGID, creds.egid as u64),
        (AT_BASE, interp_elf.map_or(0, |interp| interp.file_base as u64)),
        (AT_PAGESZ, *PAGE_SIZE),
        (AT_PHDR, main_elf.file_base.wrapping_add(main_elf.headers.file_header().phoff) as u64),
        (AT_PHNUM, main_elf.headers.file_header().phnum as u64),
        (AT_ENTRY, main_elf.vaddr_bias.wrapping_add(main_elf.headers.file_header().entry) as u64),
        (AT_SECURE, 0),
    ];
    let stack = populate_initial_stack(&stack_vmo, argv, environ, auxv, stack_base, stack)?;
#+end_src
It is immediately clear that what is populated to the initial stack from the parameter names.

*** Other conventions
There are many other implicit conventions Linux programs rely on.
For example, if you can't open stdout/stderr on your system, I expect more than 50% of the programs will crash immediately.

**** Posix compatibility
+ Many libraries
+ ~system(3)~
+ Posix threads

**** Linux standard base
+ Many libraries
+ [[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filesystem_Hierarchy_Standard][Filesystem Hierarchy Standard]]

*** Alien Interfaces
Some Interfaces are alien to ~Fuchsia~ (there are not any counterparts in ~fuchsia~).
These are the things which requires more consideration.
+ kill
+ Async Signal
+ Linux Futex

*** Performance

* Run Rabbit Run
** Android
Given all those hints on Android apex and [[https://source.android.com/devices/architecture/modular-system][Android's effort to modularize its system components]],
I wonder how long it will be till we have Android system components on ~Fuchsia~ and when the [[https://source.android.com/devices/tech/dalvik][ART]] runner will be ready.
